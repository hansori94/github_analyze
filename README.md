## Background
There are many open-source projects publicly available on GitHub that are maintained, modified and updated by various developers. Among the millions of
open-source projects on GitHub, some of them have become extremely popular to the general community, such as NumPy, React, and Bitcoin, to name a few.

We are interested in how this popularity affects the behavior of the contributors - especially the ones who had been contributing to the project even before it became popular. 

For example:
1. would early
members of the project stop caring about the project once the project gains popularity, because perhaps the project is not cool anymore now that it has become too mainstream? 

2. Or would they contribute even more
now they feel more responsible for the project? 

3. Or it might be even the case that popularity doesn’t in fact have any effect on the behavior of early contributors.

## Our question
Do early contributors tend to contribute more or less once a project has become popular?
